**I'm not good at introducing myself.**

I remember in elementary school when the teacher asked us to introduce ourselves and our families. I walked up to the podium and stood there for a long time without saying a word. I wasn't afraid or nervous at all(even though the teacher scolded me for delaying everyone's time), but for some reason, I remained silent. I still don't know why...

It wasn't until I grew up that I gradually discovered that I didn't like letting others know my thoughts, so communication and expression are up until now my weaknesses.

**I prefer to be label-free, an undefined version of myself. But I enjoy serving others, taking their joy as feedback, and keeping their casual words in my heart.**

**Front-end developer, lifelong learner...**

**After starting work, I've gained some new perspectives and a sense of numbness. I've let go of any expectations and have come to cherish memories even more.**

**I am deeply grateful to those who have patiently taught me.**

**If u like them too, then congratulations we have the same interests.**

**Passionate about programming and computer technology and eager to become a senior software engineer!**

**Why choose programming? for me，Coding is interest and life; desire: superior technology and warmth.**

**I was fortunate enough to go to the Joker Xue's Lanzhou concert.**

**I am grateful to everyone around me who has helped me.** -->
