## me

**Currently a ~~about to graduate~~ graduated computer ~~student~~ bricklayer, likes cats and Joker Xue.**

**If u like them too, then congratulations we have the same interests.**

**Passionate about programming and computer technology and eager to become a senior software engineer!**

**Why choose programming? for me，Coding is interest and life; desire: superior technology and warmth.**

**I was fortunate enough to go to the Joker Xue's Lanzhou concert.**

**I am grateful to everyone around me who has helped me.**
